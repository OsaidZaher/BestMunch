This is my first usage of React. This is an introduction project to understanding the react virtual dom and hooks as well as JSX.
This web app is a simple web app that lets the user find food places based on sorting options and the inputs they add to the search bar. The user is able to pick the amount of resteraunts to be displayed and is able to go to the Yelp page of the resteraunt when they click on the resteraunt card.
The web app uses the YelpApi to fetch the data to the initilised endpoints the user can decide.
